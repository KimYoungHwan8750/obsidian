Tesla’s New Robot Helpers Will Come Soon

```
Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, said they will start making robot helpers next year. These robots are called Optimus and will first work in Tesla’s own factories. By 2026, Tesla hopes to sell these robots to other companies too. Tesla is doing this because they need new ideas to make more money, as they are selling fewer electric cars now.

Tesla’s car sales went down by 7% compared to last year, but they still made a little more money overall. This is because their energy storage business is doing well. However, Tesla’s stock price dropped by almost 8% because people are worried about the car market. Musk wants to use new technology like robots to help Tesla work better and save money.

Musk believes the Optimus robot can do boring or dangerous jobs. He wants to make a lot of these robots and sell them for less than $20,000 each. Musk often has big plans, but sometimes they take longer than he says. For example, his idea for self-driving taxis is still not ready because of rules they need to follow. Even with these challenges, using robots could be very important for Tesla’s future.
