Scientists found out that a big stone at Stonehenge came from the north of Scotland.
과학자들은 스코틀랜드의 북부에서 온 큰 고인돌을 찾아냈다.
Before, people thought it was from south-west Wales.
그 전엔 사람들은 남west Wales에서 왔을거라고 생각했다.
This shows that people from different parts of Great Britain worked together to build Stonehenge.
이것은 고인돌을 함께 만들며 Greate Britain worked 의 다른 부분들로부터 왔다는 것을 보여준다? (잘 모르겠음)
It means they were more connected and advanced than we thought.
이것은 그들이 우리 생각보다 더 연결되어있고 고급이라는 것을 의미한다.
The discovery surprised many researchers.
이 발견은 많은 연구자들을 놀라게 했다.
A team from Curtin University in Australia studied small pieces of the stone.
호주의 Curtin 대학교에서 온 팀은 돌의 작은 부분들을 연구했다.
They found special chemicals that showed the stone came from north-east Scotland.
그들은 남동(north east?) 스코틀랜드에서 왔다는 것을 보여주는 특별한 화학적인 것을 찾아냈다.
This makes us wonder how people moved such big stones so far and why they did it.
이것은 우리를 궁금하게 만든다. 사람들이 그 먼곳에서 왜 옮겨왔는지, 어떻게 옮겼는지를.
The study helps us learn more about the people who built Stonehenge.
그 연구는 고인돌을 만든 사람들에 대해 더 알 수 있게 도와준다.
It shows they had special ways to work together and move big stones.
이것은 보여준다. 그들의 특별한 방법, 협력
Scientists are now asking more questions about how they did this.

The finding adds a new part to the story of Stonehenge and its importance in history.
